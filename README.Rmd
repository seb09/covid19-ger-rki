This repository contains data on reported COVID-19 cases in Germany and its federal states that is published daily by the Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
corona_rki <- read_csv("data/corona_deu_rki.csv")
corona_rki %>% 
  arrange(desc(Datum), Bundesland) %>% 
  print(n = 16)
```


Data is downloaded each day at 11am from the [website of the RKI](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Fallzahlen.html) (and updated again at 11pm). The time stamp refers to the day when the data was downloaded.

Population sizes of the federal states were scraped from [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_deutschen_Bundesl%C3%A4nder_nach_Bev%C3%B6lkerung) and are also available in this repo.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
population <- read_csv("data/einwohner_bundesland.csv")
population
```

I'll try to update the data daily. You can import the most recent version directly from GitHub.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
corona_rki <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seb09/covid19-ger-rki/master/data/corona_deu_rki.csv")
```

I will also produce a plot from time to time, probably in German. You're welcome to use them.
